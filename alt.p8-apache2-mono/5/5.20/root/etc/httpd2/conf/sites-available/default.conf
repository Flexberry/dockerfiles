# Summary: Main server configuration (for default virtual host)
# Provides: VirtualHost
# Provides: VirtualHost-default
#

#
# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

<VirtualHost *>
	#
	# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
	# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
	# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
	#
	ServerAdmin webmasterr@localhost

	#
	# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
	# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
	# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
	#
	# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
	#
	#ServerName www.example.com:80

	#
	# DocumentRoot: The directory out of which you will serve your
	# documents. By default, all requests are taken from this directory, but
	# symbolic links and aliases may be used to point to other locations.
	#
	DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"

	#
	# Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect
	# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
	# directory (and its subdirectories).
	#
	# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of
	# features.
	#
	<Directory />
		# Summary: Configure for all dirs by default
		# Requires: Directory-root
		Include conf/include/Directory_root_default.conf
	</Directory>

	#
	# Note that from this point forward you must specifically allow
	# particular features to be enabled - so if something's not working as
	# you might expect, make sure that you have specifically enabled it
	# below.
	#

	#
	# This should be changed to whatever you set DocumentRoot to.
	#
	<Directory "/var/www/html">
		# Summary: Configure for html documents in DocumentRoot
		# Requires: Directory-html
		Include conf/include/Directory_html_default.conf
	</Directory>

	#
	# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
	# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
	# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
	# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
	# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
	#
	ErrorLog /var/log/httpd2/error_log

	#
	# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
	# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
	# alert, emerg.
	#
	LogLevel warn

	<IfModule log_config_module>
		#
		# The location and format of the access logfile (Common Logfile Format).
		# If you do not define any access logfiles within a <VirtualHost>
		# container, they will be logged here.  Contrariwise, if you *do*
		# define per-<VirtualHost> access logfiles, transactions will be
		# logged therein and *not* in this file.
		#
		CustomLog /var/log/httpd2/access_log common

		#
		# If you prefer a logfile with access, agent, and referer information
		# (Combined Logfile Format) you can use the following directive.
		#
		#CustomLog /var/log/httpd2/access_log combined
	</IfModule>

	<IfModule alias_module>
		#
		# Redirect: Allows you to tell clients about documents that used to
		# exist in your server's namespace, but do not anymore. The client
		# will make a new request for the document at its new location.
		# Example:
		# Redirect permanent /foo http://www.example.com/bar

		#
		# Alias: Maps web paths into filesystem paths and is used to
		# access content that does not live under the DocumentRoot.
		# Example:
		# Alias /webpath /full/filesystem/path
		#
		# If you include a trailing / on /webpath then the server will
		# require it to be present in the URL.  You will also likely
		# need to provide a <Directory> section to allow access to
		# the filesystem path.

		#
		# ScriptAlias: This controls which directories contain server scripts.
		# ScriptAliases are essentially the same as Aliases, except that
		# documents in the target directory are treated as applications and
		# run by the server when requested rather than as documents sent to the
		# client.  The same rules about trailing "/" apply to ScriptAlias
		# directives as to Alias.
		#
		ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"

	</IfModule>

	#
	# "/var/www/cgi-bin" should be changed to whatever your ScriptAliased
	# CGI directory exists, if you have that configured.
	#
	<Directory "/var/www/cgi-bin">
		# Summary: Configure for default CGI directory
		# Requires: Directory-cgi
		Include conf/include/Directory_cgibin_default.conf
