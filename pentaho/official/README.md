## Running

The type of administrative base is set by the environment variable DB_ADMIN.
If the variable is not set, the built-in base HSQLDB is used.

If the variable is set to `postgresql`, the Postgres database is used as the administrative base.

PostgreSQL connection parameters are set by the environment variables:
- DB_HOST â€” server address with PostgreSQL
- DB_PORT - server port with PostgreSQL
- DB_ADMIN_USER - username with administrator rights
- DB_ADMIN_PASS - password of the user with administrator rights
- JCR_PASS - password for the user to access the database of the Jackrabbit repository
- HIBERNATE_PASS - password for the user to access the Hibernate database
- QUARTZ_PASS - password for the user to access the Quartz database

By default, Pentaho server is available on port 8080.
